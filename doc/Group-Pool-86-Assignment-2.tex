\subsection{Explanation}
\par We choose to model GameScreen, CollisionHandler, Table, Wall, Pocket, Ball, Cue and Login. Besides those classes we also modelled classes which explain links and are important.
\par Five classes -Table, Wall, Pocket, Ball and Cue- are most certainly part of the core logic, because they represent the objects in our game and contain logic (although some more than others) which make our game tick. Besides those obvious choices we also added GameScreen, CollisionHandler and Login, because the first two contain a major part of our physics logics and the final class (Login) is what makes sure the user can actually authenticate.

\par Besides those classes we added classes which are important to understand the links between classes (take LoginScreen and HomeMenuScreen for example), classes which are superclasses of our core classes (Take GameObject and some external LibGDX classes), and classes which contain logic that is fundamental to our physics (Vector3f).
