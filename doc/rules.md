# Rules
## 8-ball
### Starting
To decide which player starts, we simply randomize the player order. 
The ball type will be decided by the first pot after the break shot.

### Fouls
* Potting the black ball illegally (potting before all other balls of your type are potted) will instantly lose you the game.
* Potting the white ball will end your turn and the opposing player can place the ball at a place at his/her choice.
* Hitting a ball of the opposing player will end your turn and the opposing player can place the ball at a place at his/her choice.

### Winning
You win when you legally (potting all other balls of your type first) pot the black ball.
